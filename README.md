# Blog For A Friend
## Description:
A full-stack web application made for my friend, who can use this blog to post his experiences in Kosovo for the Peace Corps. This was also conveniently done as a project in [The Odin Project]([url](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/nodejs-blog-api)). The code is separated into three folders (client-users, client-admin, and server), hosting the user side, admin side, and server backend, respectively.

## Live View:
- Admin-Side: https://joonheebockadmin.netlify.app/
- User-Side: https://joonheebock.netlify.app/
- Server: https://joonheebock.onrender.com

## Technologies Used:
Front-End:
- React.JS
Backend:
- Express, Node.js
- MongoDB

## Concepts Learned
- Persistent Login using JWT tokens for Admin End
- Implementing Rich Text Editors such as ReactQuill and customizing the Text Editors to use Multer middleware to upload images onto the server
- How to implement queries to limit the data that's fetched

## To-Do:
If I were to come back to this project in the future, I would want to:
- Design a better UI to replace the current UI with images taken in Kosovo
- Add more features in the comments section (custom emojis and gifs)
- Add a user login for Joonhee, in case he wants to personally reply to comments and mark his message
- Add Mailchimp integration to inform readers when he makes a new post
